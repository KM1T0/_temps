          <h1>LIAM MCDOUGALL</h1>
          <h2>BODYGUARD. 30. VALHALEN. ARCHER.</h2>
          If you're looking for a conversation partner, I'd suggest you stop and turn around if it ever comes to
          settling for Liam. A lone wolf through-and-through, he works best alone with his methods. As the bodyguard and
          occasional advisor (and shoulder to cry on for the heiress) of Valhalen Corp's young heirs, it's his duty to
          ensure that they're well and alive at the end of the day; no poisoned wine, no assassinations, and no skipped
          meals.
          <br><br>
          <h1>WANTED</h1>
          <h2>A bitter past, bitter enemies.</h2> Liam used to run with some pretty unsavoury characters in his past,
          when he used to work as a mercenary-for-hire. As a result, his reformation would not go well with some of his
          past "comrades" who still seek revenge on him for snitching them out, years ago. I'd love to have someone who
          used to be an old connection harbour some sort of bitterness towards Liam, since he's living a cushy life on
          top with the Valhalens.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Corporation co-workers.</h2> Anyone else working security detail? Who also happens to look up to Liam for
          their daily planners and hostage-taking simulation training? Umm, yes sign me up please. I need a little
          goofball subordinate to pester the old dog for advice and mentorship.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Valhalen heirs.</h2> Do you have an overbearing bodyguard who wipes your mouth for you, cuts your steak
          into edible pieces, and who constantly follows you into the bathroom? Yup that's Liam. You might find him
          overbearing and overwhelming; he finds it necessary and vital to his job. I can see him being there for the
          heirs when it really matters â€” and when he really shouldn't be there at all. Hilarity ensues, yada yada. You
          know the drill.

          <h1>UNWANTED</h1>
          <br>
          Honestly, there aren't anything I won't accept. I'm pretty open. Oh, and I guess he's sort of reserved for
          @lottie, so don't get smarmy and try to charm the guy!

          <h1>INGRAM INGWAY</h1>
          <h2>SOCIALITE. 27. NELFIUM. EQUESTRIAN.</h2>
          Wealthy and respectable socialite by day, disreputable serial womanizer by night. Ingram's got family issues,
          and he's always looking for an easy way to let off steam. This can mean anything from scoring small,
          meaningless goals that give him a short-term high to combat the depressed individual he really is inside.
          <br><br>
          <h1>WANTED</h1>
          <h2>Charmed to meet you</h2> Past flings, current flings, future flings, whoever it is, it's rumoured that
          Ingram's been there, done that. I want individuals who had been burned by his infidelity from past
          engagements, and I want individuals who are still torn up over him.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Nelfium Compatriots</h2> Like the sycophant he is, he needs some Nelfium royalty to kiss ass to. Of
          course, while he tries his best to be subtle about his manipulation, and his efforts to be genuine, I do want
          someone calling Ingram out on his bullshit. Maybe even attempt to reform him; change his opinion or his
          method.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Secret Garden</h2> Having never bare his heart or his feelings, exposed, to <i>anyone, ever,</i> I'd like
          to have someone knock down his sandcastle and storm into his briar garden and like him for who he is, flaws
          and all. Ingram's convinced that he's pathetic and useless if he's not winning 100% of the time. He needs
          someone to stop that kind of harmful thinking.
