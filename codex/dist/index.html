      <div class="codexintro">Here at Megalomania, we like to give people
        the option to make whatever they would like to make. Any race goes, so you can make whatever your heart's desire is, as long as it is fantasy appropriate races and not things like cyborgs and aliens. In the Codex below, you can find links to a various number of entries for some of the various races across the land.

These are not hard rules that everyone making the race must follow, nor can you not make a race that isn't on this list! In fact we encourage you to make your own lore and get it added here! What is here is merely the lore that people who have made members of this race have come up with for said race, such as cultural customs or events for that particular race for other people to incorporate into their backstories, should they so choose.

Want to get your own lore for a race added? Post in the thread below, using the following format to see about getting it added. Note: We ask that any lore you add not be excessively limiting to a particular race as a whole, such as saying you are the last of X race and nobody else can play them, or that all of X race have to dyslexic. This is meant to be something for people to build off of, not to shut people out.</div>

      <h1>Demons</h1>
      <blockquote>Demons are a diverse race, and some have argued that by their very nature they do not qualify as a singular "race" but rather a catch-all term for supernatural creatures that fall into no other category. Some of them are associated with animals, such as bird demons or snake demons, while others hold resemblance to no creature but humans but have access to innate supernatural powers that mark them as decidedly inhuman. 

Like Humans, the disposition of demons comes in many shapes, although most of them tend to be rather antagonistic toward humanity. This is not a general rule however, and there have even been noted cases of certain demons assisting or binding themselves into the service of humans for their own reasons, such as in the case of the Kingdom of ______. 

For this reason, there are many different forms and factions of Demons spread across the world, each with their own agendas and desires, and there is no concrete rules as to what can and cannot be a demon. They are often much longer lived and naturally superior to humans, but numerically they are inferior to them in most places, and have more difficulty siring offspring. Half-breeds tend to share much of their demonic lineage unless mixed with another supernatural race, with half-human children being the most likely to closely resemble their demonic parent.</blockquote>

        <h1>SINS</h1>
        <blockquote>There are a particular type of demons known as Sin Demons, whom have a more precise contempt for humanity and their gods. These Sin demons each belong to one of seven Cardinal Sins, and both draw their strength from said sin being performed in the world and attempt to spread the committing of that sin throughout the sentient races of the mortal realm.

Sin demons can belong to another type of demon, such as being a wolf demon or an incubus, so long as they possess the aspect of one of the seven cardinal sins. Becoming such a demon is possible through various means, although they tend to happen more as tragic miracles rather than through planned ordination. The only common factor among all of them is that becoming a sin demon bestows a hatred for the mortal races as a whole, and even more strongly an intense hatred of Orpheus, the reigning god. For this reason they are the natural enemies of the Church and Angels alike.

Sins can fall into one of seven categories: Wrath, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, and Pride. Each aspect has their collective power distributed across all those who share their aspect: As all Wrath demons draw their power from the rage of the mortal races, they may each only gain a portion of the collective power that they could have. For this reason, it is not uncommon for Sins of the same nature to fight among themselves for more power and influence, as by dwindling their numbers they may consolidate their power. The only exception to this is Pride, as Pride demons suffer no others to share their power and move to kill one another immediately, consolidating all of their power into one individual. For this reason, the current reigning Pride demon is often seen as the de facto "leader" of all Sin Demons. It is possible for more than one Pride demon to exist, but they are driven by a near uncontrollable urge to kill other Pride Demons, which often leads to the death of the weaker.

Unlike most demons, Sin Demons are usually trapped within the realm of the dead, although they have found various means to escape this imprisonment. By possessing an individual who heavily embodies their trait, they are able to transport themselves into the mortal world. Some sin demons have even been summoned to the mortal world, either purposely through ritual magic or accidentally at some apex of their representative sin. Those who are converted in the mortal realm may remain until their death, and all sins when killed return to the realm of the dead, barring certain conditions.

There are several ways to permanently kill a sin. Those killed within the Realm of the Dead, for whatever reason, suffer a complete death. In addition, those killed by another Sin will have their souls destroyed or devoured depending on the manner of Sin, with those of the same nature absorbing their essence to fuel themselves. Certain holy rituals and weapons, either those of the angels or those of Orpheus, have also been able to stop the Sins spirit from escaping and destroy it utterly.</blockquote>

      <h1>Humans</h1>
      <blockquote>The most widespread race across _____, Humans make up the majority of the population. While they are weaker than some races, their adaptable nature gives them advantages over some of the other more normal supernatural races, being faster than dwarves, possessing more endurance than elves, and things of the like. Their greatest advantage however has shown to be their ability to cooperate, both within their own race and with others, often forming strong communities and nations to overcome their shortcomings to survive the harsh reality of their world.

Not more than a few hundred years ago, Humans were an underdog race, one that was often little more than cattle in the hands of other supernatural beings. All this changed whenever they developed the ability to use magic themselves, allowing them to fight back against other supernatural entities and begin to gather in groups large enough to defend themselves by their own strength and not merely in the shadow of others. While their magic is often much younger and less inherently powerful than older, ancient magics, the innovation and capabilities of human magic is some of the most diverse in the world, as it has the possibility for growth that older forms of magic have long since lost, making it incredibly diverse and unpredictable compared to other forms of magic.

Most humans worship Orpheus as their God, along with many other races. The church dedicated to him is primarily made up of humans, although no race is excluded from his worship.</blockquote>

        <h1>SILLAGE</h1>
        <blockquote>The odd property that began appearing in humans, allowing them to use magic in a manner similar to other races of the world. It is a spark that is unique to mankind, a well of energy within their soul that only they can manipulate, with some being more prominent in it's use than others. This is the reason for the strength and unpredictability of human magic, and is one of the cornerstones of human civilization.

That said, Sillage comes with it's own downsides. The extended, unregulated use of this energy leads to a growing instability in the mind of it's user, eventually turning to madness. This is most pronounced on special days of the year, such as Aphelion, where those with greater amounts of sillage feel the madness of its effects the most strongly. For this reason, Orpheus, in his divine wisdom, devised ways of managing the effects of this madness, with the Church being able to mollify or even outright cure the insanity brought about by it with their divine blessings and miracles. For this reason, many users of sillage have sought out the assistance of the Church or devoted themselves to it, although a number of more cloistered scholarly organizations have created their own ways of managing these side effects.

Some heretics believe that Sillage is the product of another god, by the name of Eleftherios, gifted to humans in an act of pity to save them from the world of an uncaring god. In addition, this heresy further expands to say that the madness inherent within it is not part of it's original design, but rather a curse laid down by Orpheus in an act of petty revenge, and that the Church's ability to "treat" it only stems from the fact that it's origin is the same as that of their powers. The Church obviously heavily denies all such allegations, and considers the mention of them blasphemy. </blockquote>
