		<div class="about-blurb">
			Hello, my name is Nines.
			<br><br>
			I create Jcink skins for roleplaying forums in my spare time. I work as a full-time project designer for an interior design firm, based in Toronto.
			<br><br>
			This is a comprehensive document for clients wishing to commission me for a Jcink skin, along with price quotes.

		<h1>POLICIES</h1>
		<h2>PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU COMMISSION</h2>

		<h3><i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> COMPATIBILITY</h3>
		<blockquote>
			All skins are designed and coded for <b>Google Chrome</b>. Some aspects may not show up on other browsers (scrollbars on Firefox, etc.) so please be mindful of that.
			<br><br>
			I work in a <b>1920x1080</b> resolution environment, so therefore my skins will look best in that resolution. I will however, accommodate smaller-width screens always, and will try my best to adapt to your needs.
			<br><br>
			Currently I <u>do not</u> accept commissions for dynamic skinning.
		</blockquote>

		<h3><i class="fas fa-hand-receiving"></i> USAGE</h3>
		<blockquote>
			Upon completion of the skin and transaction is confirmed & approved, the skin now belongs to you! You are free to edit and customize it however you want. The skin is prohibited from a resale (you cannot sell it back). <b>My credit must remain intact and cannot be edited/deleted/etc.</b>
			<br><br>
			<b>Disclaimer:</b> Once the code is handed over, you are free to edit it however you wish but please be mindful that I will not be offering any support on edits made on the skin. It is recommended that you keep a copy of the skin intact and you have someone with knowledge with code to help you make revisions if you wish to do so. I do not offer support on how to use or navigate Jcinkâ€™s ACP, either.
			<br><br>
			I will offer light edits or troubleshooting on installation if you contact me within one week of date of purchase. I will not offer support afterwards.
			<br><br>
			As owner of the skin, you are allowed to use it on as many sites as you wish <u>as long as those sites are owned by you.</u>
			<br><br>
			Any graphics made for the skin also belongs to you. I will not reuse or recycle them for other projects in any way.
		</blockquote>
		<h3><i class="far fa-credit-card"></i> PAYMENT</h3>
		<blockquote>
			Prices vary depending on the complexity of the project. I have three different packages available, each with varying levels of details and are priced accordingly, so you can select whichever package best fits your needs and/or budget.
			<br><br>
			All fees should be paid upfront when the commission is completed and ready to be handed over, so please prepare accordingly. The skin will be transferred once payment is submitted and approved.
			<br><br>
			For the <b>Full Works Package</b>, I will require a <b>non-refundable deposit</b> of $50USD, upfront. This is to ensure the legitimacy and commitment of the commission for both parties.
			<br><br>
			The commissioned skin, once completed and finished, is non-refundable; however, you may cancel your commission at any time before full payment has been made. Please note that a commission that has been cancelled can and will be repurposed for a premade sale.
		</blockquote>
		<h3><i class="far fa-file-contract"></i> TERMS OF AGREEMENT</h3>
		<blockquote>
			By commissioning me, you agree to the following terms:
			<ol>
				<li>I retain the right to showcase your commissioned skin on my personal website for portfolio purposes.</li>
				<li>You acknowledge that I will not offer any support in helping with revisions or edits to the commissioned skin, a week after transferal and transaction has been completed.</li>
				<li>You will leave my credit (which will be minimal) on the skin intact.</li>
				<li>You will not re-sell my skin, and should you use it on multiple sites you must be the owner of them.</li>
				<li>I reserve the right to refuse or cancel your commission.*</li>
			</ol>
			<i style="font-size:11px;">*In the case of a deposit, should I cancel your commission your deposit will be returned in full.</i>
