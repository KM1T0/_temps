    <p><b>Welcome to Atlas, 2384 A.D.</b>
      
      The infrastructure of Earth has changed vastly to accommodate the explosive population burst, almost a century prior. In order to preserve humanity's survival, a group of scientists ventured off-world and brought back alien technology from a distant star system, known as "Elder Technology".
    
    Research rapidly developed a new form of survival that proved beneficial in extending one's lifespan – no, it was most definitely "immortality".
      
      By encoding the memories and personality of an individual into a device made with Elder Tech called a "cortical stack", one could literally digitize their consciousness and "upload" it into their stack.
    
    Humans could live forever.
    
    However, immortality comes with a price. With the technology heavily regulated and physical bodies known as "sleeves" on a constant shortage at exorbitant prices, only the rich, privileged and illustrious are allowed to subsist in this world for centuries to come.</p>

    <h1 class="epee">ATLAS</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The fictional setting of Gestalt takes place in <b>The Annexed Territories of the Linear Atlantic Sprawl</b> or 'ATLAS'. ATLAS is a sprawling megalopolis (or “supercity") consisting of a cluster of smaller cities that have merged into a super hub overflowing with technology, economic growth, and human achievements.
      
      This urban sprawl covers most of the west coast of what was formerly known as North America, where former megacities and regions have melded together to form this digital environment.
      
Within Atlas, there is no real climate nor day-and-nighttime interchange; an artificial, blackened sky perpetuates above all. One can describe Atlas as a stage where the actors will always change, but the play stays the same.

Atlas is divided into several different stratum (“layers”) that dictate an individual’s caste and ranking within society. From the wealthiest living in homes suspended in high orbit in the earth’s stratosphere, to the poorest live at the bottom, near the Earth’s surface, where most of the smog and pollution and the clutter of waste deposits have ravaged any sort of natural life.</p>

<h1 class="epee">DISTRICTS</h1>
<hr>
<p>There are four main districts (also known as "stratum") in ATLAS, each one layered on top of one another. The upper stratum are smaller in size compared to the bottom stratum, with the top stratum extending past the clouds and into the stratosphere.</p>
<h2 class="riposte">HYPERION</h2>
<blockquote>
Reaching 35,000 feet above the clouds, resides Hyperion where only the most elite of the elite in Atlas resides; the super-rich, the super-wealthy.<br><br>These homes are suspended on top of spindle-shaped Bernal spheres that are designed for living at high altitudes. At this height, Hyperion residents are free from the barricade of the artificial sky and are privileged to bask in real, natural sunlight while surrounded by clouds and blue skies.<br><br>It costs several lifetimes to accumulate enough fortunes to be able to afford living on Hyperion.<br>
<span class="ward">Wealth: <span style="color:#bbb;">$$$$$</span></span>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2 class="riposte">SELENE</h2>
<blockquote>
Not all members of high society are necessarily Hyperion residents. Those who can find comfortable lodging and membership to the stratum of Selene includes many high-profile members of government, including celebrities, investors, and many other elites.<br><br>Members of the community will find themselves surrounded by state-of-the-art technology and digital spaces; luxuries from the old world such as owning real, bioengineered animals as personal pets include just some of the perks.<br>
<span class="ward">Wealth: <span style="color:#bbb;">$$$$<span class="opacity">$</span></span></span>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2 class="riposte">ASTERIA</h2>
<blockquote>
The most populous stratum, where most individuals of society would find themselves in. The economic strength of households ranges from the lower end of the middle-class spectrum, to those who are more affluent. Parts of Asteria can be considered very safe – just as there are parts where crime can run unchecked at times.<br>
<span class="ward">Wealth: <span style="color:#bbb;">$$<span class="opacity">$$$</span></span> ~ <span style="color:#bbb;">$$$<span class="opacity">$$</span></span></span>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2 class="riposte">PROMETHEUS</h2>
<blockquote>
A stratum lying in the deepest depths of Atlas, those who cannot afford housing in Asteria’s stratum are downgraded to the hellish level of Prometheus. Crime runs rampant in these streets, and with the limited amount of law enforcement allocated to this stratum, many find themselves falling deeper into the rabbit hole in order to simply <i>survive.</i><br>
<span class="ward">Wealth: <span style="color:#bbb;">$<span class="opacity">$$$$</span></span> ~ <span style="color:#bbb;">$$<span class="opacity">$$$</span></span></span>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2 class="riposte">OUTLIER</h2>
<blockquote>
Those who are bits of data that simply do not fall in anywhere else. People who were erased from the system, but escaped by resleeving. Renegades, rogues, wayfarers, vagrants. They travel where they please, breaking laws that should be abided by. Or are they simply somehow forgotten, undetected from the System?<br>
<span class="ward">Wealth: <span style="color:#bbb;">UNKNOWN</span></span>
